K18: Filler and Finery â€” inline
2020-01-13

  - Our Lorem Ipsum generator (Hipsum): https://hipsum.co/
  - We learned that by using text-decoration: none, we could remove the underline
    in a hyperlink.
  - We used trial and error to find background and font colors that matched the
    sample png (for example, we also experimented with #cecece, #cfcfcf, #cdcdcd
    while finding the correct color for the h1 foo box).
  - We also played around with a lot of fonts. While we initially decided to use
    arial, we ended up using helvetica neue (though not identical to the sample
    png, helvetica neue is also used on the stuycs.org webpage, making it a good
    choice).
  - When creating our two columns in the middle section of the webpage, we decided
    to move away from absolute measurements (200px, 600px, etc). We tried using
    vw, but we ended up settling on percentages (24% and 76%), which are relative
    measurements.
  - We don't know if this is intentional, but the margin on the right side is larger
    than the margin on the left side throughout the entire webpage. We included
    this in our code by giving our h1 foo box, our main box, and our copyright box
    a right margin of 7px.
  - Once we had established the inline version, transforming our code into the
    internal and external versions was straightforward.
